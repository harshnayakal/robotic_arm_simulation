# robotic_arm_simulation
This code simulates a robotic arm with multiple joints using forward kinematics. The RoboticArm class computes the position of the end-effector based on link lengths and joint angles. The FuncAnimation in matplotlib dynamically updates the arm's joint angles, creating an animation that visualizes the arm's motion as it moves over time.
